# README.md

This readme is exclusively written by Arnav Gautam `(ID: 12140280)` explaining the sequential and parallel program execution steps:

1. Sequential Program:
The seq.cc file is the file that needs to be compiled. You can change the values of N and R as per required.

2. Parallel Program:
The Parallel Program was written in the Google Colab Platform since my personal device (MacOS) didn't support Nvidia. The execution can be performed by setting the runtime to T4 GPU and all the required commands are already written in the .ipynb shared. The values of N_Threads (gridSize in code) and Number of Thread Blocks (blockSize in code) can be changed as required to find the desired results.

The link for Google Colab (for parallel program): https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kLqzWDR6C17bHS9rM1pxWNGhfp5RtIPJ?usp=sharing

The report is attached with filled up information.
